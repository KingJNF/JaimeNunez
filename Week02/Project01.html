    Your eyes, first of all, would glide over the <div style="background:#808080; color:white">
  grey fitted carpet in the narrow, long and high-ceilinged corridor, 
  its walls would be cupboards, in light-coloured wood, 
  with fittings of gleaming brass.

    The Derby winner Thunderbird, <br><br>A paddle-steamer named Ville-de-Motitereau,<br><br> 
    and a Stephenson locomotive, <br><br>
  
  would lead to a leather curtain hanging on thick, 
    black, grainy wooden rings which would slide back at the merest touch. 
    There, the carpet would give way to an almost<br><br>
  
  <div style="background:#FFFF00;">
  yellow woodblock floor, 
    partly covered by <br>three <br>faded <br>rugs.

     on the left
  </div> <br>in a kind of recess,<br> 
  
  there would be a large sofa upholstered in worn black leather,

    Above the sofa, a mariner’s chart would fill the whole length of that section of the wall. On the other side of a small low table, and beneath a silk prayer-mat nailed to the wall with 
  
  <br><br> 3 <br>large-headed <br>brass studs<br><br>

  matching the leather curtain, there would be another sofa, at right angles to the first, 
    <div style="color:brown">
     <br> with a light-brown velvet covering; 
  </div> 
 <br>  <div style="color:red">
  it would lead on to a small and spindly piece of furniture,

 And providing 3 display shelves for knick-knacks: <br> <br>

    Then, on the other side of another door, beyond a low, square revolving bookcase supporting a large, 
  cylindrical vase decorated in <div style=  "color: blue"> blue </div> and filled with <div style= "background-color: yellow">
  
  yellow roses, </div> <br>
  
    set beneath an oblong mirror in a mahogany frame,

    It would be all in browns, ochres, duns and yellows:

    Slightly to the left of the window and at a shallow angle would be <br><br>
      
      <div style="padding:20px; color: white; border: brown 5px solid; background:#C19A6B">
      a long country table covered 
        with <div style="color:red"> a large red blotter.</div> Wooden boxes, flat pen-holders and pots of all kinds would hold pencils, paper-clips, staples large and small.<br> <br>A glass tile would serve as an ashtray. <br>
        A circular black leather box decorated with <div style="color:#D4AF37">

    fitted with a<div style="color:green">green opaline lampshade shaped like a visor.</div><br><br> 
        
    On each side of the table, virtually facing each other, <br>would be <br><br> high-backed wood & leather armchairs. <br><br>
        <div style= "text-align:right">   high-backed wood & leather armchairs. </div><br><br>

        Still further to the left, along the wall, would be <br> <br><div style="padding: 1px; color: white; border: brown 1px solid; background:#C19A6B">
        a narrow table overflowing with books. </div><br>

        <div style="color:green">  A wing-chair in bottle-green leather </div> would lead to <div style="color:grey">grey metal filing cabinets</div>

<div style="padding: 1px; color: white; border: brown 1px solid; background:#C19A6B">    
  On a third, even smaller table would be a Swedish lamp and a typewriter under its canvas dust-cover. </div><br>

  <p>
    There, life would be easy, simple. 
    All the servitudes, all the problems brought by material existence would find a natural solution. 
    A cleaning lady would come every morning. Every fortnight, wine, oil and sugar would be delivered. 
    There would be a huge, bright kitchen with <div style="background:blue; color:white"> blue tiles</div> decorated with heraldic emblems, 
three china plates decorated with <div style="background:yellow; color:black">yellow arabesques</div> in metallic paint, cupboards everywhere, 
   <div style="padding: 1px; color: black; border: brown 1px solid; background:#FEFEFD">  a handsome whitewood table in the middle with stools and bench-seats. 
    On the table there would be a sizeable stoneware butter dish, jars of marmalade, honey, toast, grapefruit cut in two. </div>

  <p>
  They would open the mail, they would open the newspapers. 
  They would light their first cigarette. They would go out.
  Their work would keep them busy for a few hours only, in the morning. They would meet for lunch, a sandwich or a steak, according to their mood; they would have coffee at a street cafe and then go home, on foot, slowly.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    Their flat would rarely be tidy, but its very untidiness would be its greatest charm. 
    They would hardly bother themselves with it: they would live in it. 
    The comfort of their surroundings would seem to them to be an established fact, a datum, 
    a state of their nature. Their attention would be elsewhere: on the book they would open, 
    on the text they would draft, on the record they would listen to, 
    on their dialogue engaged afresh each day. They would work for a long while. 
    Then they would dine, or go out for dinner; they would see old friends; they would walk together.
