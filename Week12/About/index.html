      These video games have had an influence on me. Whether it be which type of
      games I played going forward or on my life in general. Whether it’s for
      their amazing music, graphics, outstanding gameplay or just overall fun
      and variety. Coming up with a list of thirty games is no easy task. With
      only looking at games with the most impact on my life makes it a bit
      easier. Below is a brief rundown on when I first crossed path with the
      game and why they made the list.

      This is another RPG but slightly different. This had a unique art style
      with a unique 2D isometric view. On top of that it had a unique
      soundtrack. The RPGs before this either had some type of electronic or
      instrumental classic music. This one had a jazz instrumental soundtrack
      which is relaxing and different. The battle system was unique with its
      Master/Apprentice system along with its likeable characters. This game
      with its world building hooked me enough to later purchase its
      predecessors when they were re-released later for the Game Boy Advance.

      This game expanded and refined the system and gameplay from Symphony of
      the Night. Since this was on the Game Boy Advance it was portable, so it
      was a nice bonus to an already great game. It also added a tarot system
      which provided additional items to collect and use during battle.

      This game got me into the Castlevania series. It combined the item locked
      progression of A Link to the Past with RPG elements like equipping weapons
      and armor and traditional leveling up system. All this in a nice-looking
      side scrolling platforming action adventure game. You play inside a castle
      trying to bring down Dracula. But just when you think its over the game
      provides extra content in trying it all over again but this time the
      castle has been literally turned upside down.

      Part of my core four RPGs. The last of the four I played. One of my
      favorite games overall of all time. One of the first games to stand out
      for me due to its music from beginning to end barring some exceptions.
      This music is so great I have not only the original soundtrack on Spotify
      I have many cover songs of this game's soundtrack. A lot of replayability
      due to its multiple endings. This game was created by a dream team of game
      developers. The creators of the Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and
      Dragonball franchises, along with other legends and legends in the making
      joined forces to create one of the greatest games of all time. Nothing has
      been created like it since. Except for its horrible mobile port this is
      the only game on the list I bought each iteration that has been released.
      Although the best version is the one released for the Nintendo DS.

      First beat ‘em up played. Catchy music. Like many games on the NES console
      it was brutally hard. If you wanted any chance of getting to the later
      levels and even the final boss, you had to play with another player. What
      made the game great was the basis of verbal communication required when
      playing co-op. You had to since you could hit and do damage to the other
      player if they were too close.

    <p>
      First and only true MMORPG I ever got into. This was my natural
      progression from traditional console RPGS which were my bread and butter
      until then. Although console RPGs had a ton more content than other
      genres, they all had one thing in common. They eventually end. Yes, you
      can go back and replay certain sections or try finding new secrets or
      areas, but you eventually exhaust everything in the game. Not with
      Everquest. This was a thriving online world carrying on even when you were
      not playing. There were players playing in real time at all hours. You can
      explore and try things on your own. Or you can join up with others
      exploring dungeons or fighting monsters. Although I played the bulk of my
      time during my high school years, I still have my original characters on
      my original account. I still have the game on my home computer and have
      jumped on occasionally to check out new features or take advantage of a
      limited time offer.

      Third of the four core RPGs. First traditional mainline Final Fantasy I
      played. Before this I played Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. It had a simple
      plot, simple characters with a linear storyline. And then part six drops.
      Before I continue though you might wonder why I call it part six if the
      link says part three? Back then SquareSoft, the company behind the Final
      Fantasy series did not release all them in the US. So, what the US got at
      the time was called Final Fantasy III. In Japan it was called Final
      Fantasy VI. Anyway, convoluted history aside this game did not disappoint.
      It had a massive cast. Sixteen characters between main cast and secret
      optional characters. And that is not including the multiple guest
      characters. All with unique battle skills/abilities. A magic system in a
      similar vein and a more simplified pre-cursor to the Materia system found
      in Final Fantasy VII. One of the few RPGs turning the genre upside down
      with having a linear progression during its first half and after a short
      sequence of events half a fully open second half of the game. You can if
      you want to explore and rejoin with the rest of the party or taking the
      few you have and attempting to take down the final boss if you dare.

      I have mentioned previously a core four of RPGs. All four of those games
      are on this list. The common theme between them was they all were on the
      SNES. They solidified my love for the genre. I had not played an RPG up
      until those four. They did not disappoint. Final Fantasy 7 however, is not
      part of the group although it was my first RPG right afterwards. It is
      significant due to its popularity causing my older brother in buying a
      PlayStation 1 just for this game. This game moved consoles. This
      introduced the PlayStation family of consoles to our world and it hasn't
      left. Ever since then we have in some iteration a Nintendo and PlayStation
      console side-by-side. Although we did have a Sega Genesis in the 16-bit
      era this was our first foray for a long time with buying a non-Nintendo
      console. It was also the first console we bought from a company with no
      previous experience in the video game industry. Back to the game though.
      The story and graphics at the time were mind blowing. This was the first
      RPG done with 3D graphics. It had cinematic CGI cutscenes. An amazing
      soundtrack with a great cast of lovable and memorable characters. A
      surprising amount of mini-games and variety. A battle system with a depth
      only limited by your imagination. Another game with massive replayability.
      This game has so many secrets I only found after watching someone else
      play it. This after playing it many times over albeit over twenty years
      ago. I write this shortly after the release of this game's remake
      released. Currently I am unable to purchase the game or its console.
      However, sooner rather than later the time will come for history to repeat
      itself and buy a new console, in this case the PlayStation 4 Pro, to be
      able to play one single game, which is Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Any other
      games purchased for it will be a bittersweet bonus.

      2nd game played of the core four RPGs and my first Final Fantasy game. It
      has a great soundtrack which does not get boring even with all the battles
      you must go through. Unfortunately, not a lot of replayability due to some
      glitches and a very linear plot with the little alternate routes available
      are not only few and far between they are simply shortcuts letting you
      finish the game quicker. However, it does have more interactivity outside
      of battle than most RPGs at the time. The main character can jump freely
      and use their main weapon outside of battle. (IE: Use your axe to cut down
      trees, use your bombs to blow up some walls, etc.). Unfortunately, since
      this game is a spin off, little if anything of this title has been
      mentioned in other games part of the franchise, spin off or not.

      Nice beat em up with multiple paths. Although it was technically not my
      game, it was a birthday gift from my mother to my younger brother. We
      played it together on his birthday and defeated it a few hours later. This
      solidified my decision to investigate other genres which eventually lead
      me into RPGs. I wanted to keep playing video games but those with more
      story, content and length since video game purchases were few and far
      between.

      The first and only FPS game I got into. Whether playing it solo trying to
      get all the objectives of each mission completed or in group local co-op
      play were some of the most fun times I had growing up. No other FPS was
      able to catch my attention since. The most remixes of the original Bond
      theme you can possibly think of were in this game. And for a movie-based
      video game it had enough fresh content to keep you occupied for a while
      along with a bunch of unlockable content. There was an updated version of
      the multiplayer created by modders with polished graphics and online play
      to give this game a second life among more hardcore fans.

      Got me into the open world sandbox genre. A game where you play as a
      criminal was different to me. Most others until that point has me playing
      as a hero or someone thrust into a heroic role and doing the right thing.
      Here the right thing is choosing between beating up gang members to death
      and taking their money or murdering other criminals for their bounty. Or
      if you want more structure meet up with less than savory members of the
      Liberty City underworld completing missions for them. It can involve
      almost anything. From killing a star witness in a federal case to dropping
      off escorts at a party for police officers. It created a whole new genre
      with other games trying to dethrone it there is only still one true king.
      Despite the other franchises this is the only series in the genre that I
      come back to. Albeit my last true foray was San Andreas and GTA IV I am
      itching to play GTA V. Possibly delving into its online mode being my
      first foray into a true online game in a long while.

      This RPG is a remake of an original game from the Sega Saturn. A
      short-lived console produced this game and its sequel, Lunar 2: Eternal
      Blue. This was the first time I heard of and able to purchase the
      collector's edition version of a game. This included an individual CD with
      the game's soundtrack. This was when I started really delving into the
      music aspect of video games. It has a great but simple storyline with
      likeable characters in a believable world. It was also the first game I
      played with voice acting. This also was the first RPG to have a song with
      vocals. Something that would not happen again until many years later.

      An action adventure game focusing on stealth. This game was basically an
      interactive movie that the franchise would eventually become known for.
      Great cast of voice actors and engaging, deep, thought provoking story.
      Different endings and difficulty levels added to the replayability factor.
      The gameplay was satisfying and treating each area of the game as its own
      type of puzzle providing for a unique experience.

      This is the only sports game on the list for good reason. This took the
      traditional 5 on 5 professional sport of basketball and turned it into a 2
      on 2 arcade game for the SNES. You do not play as unknowns instead you
      pick from various duos from all the NBA teams and a few special teams.
      What stood out was the ability to make special shots by standing on
      certain icons that randomly appear on the hardwood. Or pick up other icons
      making you shoot better or move faster.

      First portable RPG I played. I became more sociable in school with my
      classmates. Although, hard to believe for those who know me now but back
      then I was awkward and shy. This opened me up to be more talkative since
      we had a common topic. We would not only trade Pokémon we would talk about
      newly discovered strategies or talk about rumors of the current game and
      new games of the franchise coming out soon. Although I fell off Pokémon
      after Pokémon Gold and did not become active again until Pokémon Go for a
      little bit. This game laid the foundation for making games more sociable
      and more acceptable in society in general. Up until then it was more
      played solo or in small groups and never spoken of as publicly as it is
      now.

      My first legitimate PC game. It was a racing game. It had several
      different modes along with a variety of high-end luxury vehicles like
      Lamborghini, Porsche, and Ferrari to drive around. It also had a mode
      where you could be chased by the cops and lose your race if you were
      caught by them. It was a great game that helped me get into PC gaming in
      general.

      The first game I played from a non-Nintendo console. It was a different
      platformer compared to Mario games since it was based more on speed than
      precise jumping. And just like the first Mario game it has great music.
      This character's live action movie was the first movie we took our son to
      who thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.

      The only shoot em up game on this list. This game had many branching paths
      and secrets to be found. A lot of replayability here and tons of voice
      acting.

      The only collection of games on the list. This consisted of several games:
      Super Mario Bros., Lost Levels, Super Mario Bros. 2, and Super Mario Bros
      3. Lost Level is the original Mario Bros. 2 released only in Japan. Mario
      Bros 2 is the American version. Except for Super Mario Bros I never played
      any of the games in this collection. And getting four classic fun games
      for the price of one is an awesome deal.

      First video game I ever played. No instructions except a simple controller
      with five buttons. Stage 1-2 Underground theme and stage 1-1 Main theme
      have stuck around so much with me my toddler hums it randomly from time to
      time. I did not beat it for the first time until many years later, but it
      still had a profound impact on me. I would not be able to make this list
      if it were not for this simple platformer.

      First of the core four RPGs I played and my gateway game into the RPG
      genre which I have never truly left. This took the beloved world of Super
      Mario and added RPG elements. The battle system is and still unique to the
      genre with timed attacks. It is the first time the main villain of the
      series, Bowser, as a playable character. The music was a great blend of
      remixed Mario classics and new songs that fit the world. Like many
      SquareSoft games at the time, there were many secrets to be found. With
      this game coming out during the infancy of the internet many rumors were
      scattered about online. Some were true and others were not. This game was
      impactful to me due to it giving me a game lasting a long while before
      beating it initially. Even after its initial completion I would start a
      new file and experiment with trying a different section or battle slightly
      different or investigating one of its many rumors.

      Its music was catchy and the first Mario game I beat from beginning to
      end. So much replayability due to the branching paths and all the secrets.
      Even up to this day there are some stages I have not seen on a
      playthrough. Yoshi quickly became a new favorite character as it became
      for others.

      The first fighting game I got into. Before then, I had played Mortal
      Kombat and Street Fighter games here and there but never got into the
      genre due to the moves being too complex. For Smash Bros however, the move
      set was simple enough to pick up easily yet complex enough to have
      something to improve on. This was the only fighting game series I ever got
      into until I started playing casually recently Injustice and Ultimate
      Marvel Vs Capcom 3.

      Although I have played many games in my lifetime the majority on this list
      came out many years ago. To put this into perspective there is a
      seventeen-year gap between when the last games on this list dropped and
      Smash Ultimate. This was one was impactful because it brought in all the
      characters and stages from the previous games and more. Currently, they
      are still releasing new characters for this game. What really made this
      game meaningful to me is it is the first video game I played together with
      my son. He was barely three, but he has gone from "playing" with us using
      a disconnected controller for another console to now playing alongside my
      brothers and me.

      Although initially released in Japan this was my first dive into fan
      translated/modded games. To put it in perspective I played this back in
      '98. This released in Japan in 95/96. This would not be officially
      released in the States until 2003. Great RPG with a nice cast. Introduced
      a more engaging battle system having to move characters during battle
      besides just attacking, defending, and using items. A lot of content and
      enough varied good playable characters that it was the first time I had
      internal debates on who to include in my party.

      My first foray into the Zelda series. It scratched my itch of exploration
      with little story but two large worlds to explore. Replayability was high
      with this one since you were only restricted to your items and your
      imagination. A nice soundtrack accompanied with an action-oriented
      fighting system. Even to this day I play a modified version where modders
      figured out how to change the location of all the items in the game but
      still allowing you to complete it. Along with new modes, playable sprites,
      and modified music they have breathed new life into this 16-bit classic.

      First game I got hyped for. I had gotten into the series via A link to the
      Past (Another game on this list). This game was the first 3D action
      adventure game that got me hooked into true 3D gaming which was relatively
      new at the time. Massive replayability and secrets abound. This laid the
      foundation for the future of the franchise and its future has not looked
      better brighter. If you can pick up the 3DS version of this game which has
      polished, updated graphics.

      First racing game I played. Only four cars to choose from but each had
      different speeds which affected its fuel consumption. Although it was made
      up racetracks each took place in a different part of the world. Brazil,
      France, England, Japan, USA, and more places to visit going fast. The
      music of the first track is catchy and like most games on the list the
      overall soundtrack albeit small was of a good quality. With its fuel
      consumption mechanic came pit stops which added a layer of strategy to a
      racing game which was not really seen by me until then.

      The only card game on the list. This is a card game with a twist. It is
      based off the popular anime series and collectible card game. It was
      unique for including physical items in a non-collector or limited-edition
      version of the game. Every copy included three cards which could be used
      in the physical game. In addition, each card had a code on it which upon
      entering an in-game menu allows you to use it in the game. The game was
      based off the cards and rules at the time of the real-life card game. This
      provided a safe easy way to practice and playtest strategies and combos
      without sinking a ton of money into the actual card game. It allowed you
      to play and practice while on the go.
